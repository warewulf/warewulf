  container shell` environment to indicate the container in use. #579

- `wwctl node edit` supports directly editing or defining node
  configuration YAML in an editor. #540
- `wwctl node export` and `wwctl node import` support importing and
  exporting node definitions as YAML or (for import) CSV. The CSV file
  must have a header in where the first field must always be the
  nodename, and the rest of the fields are the same as the long
  commandline options. Network device must have the form
  `net.$NETNAME.$NETOPTION`. (e.g., `net.default.ipaddr`) #540
- The `warewulfd.service` systemd unit file now supports `execreload`
  and `execstop`. #550
- Network interfaces now accept an `mtu` attribute. #549
- The `wwinit` overlay now supports network interface configuration
  via NetworkManager for Ethernet and InfiniBand interfaces. #539
- Default node attribute values (e.g., for kernel arguments) are now
  read in from a `defaults.conf` configuration file. If this file
  is not present, built-in default values are used. #539
- [Warewulf documentation](https://warewulf.org/docs/) is now managed
  alongside the Warewulf source code in a single code repository so
  that documentation may be updated alongside code changes.
- New man pages for `warewulf.conf` and `nodes.conf` #510
- An initial cut of the [Warewulf API](API.md) #471
- `wwctl show --render` shows overlay templates as they would be
  rendered on a given target node. #467
- `wwctl ssh` now supports Bash completion. #466

### Changed

- `wwctl overlay edit` no longer saves a new template to the overlay
  if the template is not modified from its initial state. #522
- The wwinit overlay now only sets a name for a network interface if
  that interface has a MAC address defined. #553
- `wwctl container delete` now also deletes the built images
  associated with that container. #214
- Unified internal code paths for `wwctl profile` and `wwctl node`
  commands, and between the on disk YAML format and the in memory
  format, enabling the command-line options to be autogenerated from
  the datastructures and ensuring that profile and node capabilities
  remain in sync. Multiple command line arguments have been updated or
  changed. #495, #637
- `wwctl power` commands no longer separates node output with
  additional whitespace. #514

### Fixed

- `/etc/warewulf/excludes` (read from the node image) once again
  excludes files from being included in the node image. #532
- `wwctl ssh` always uses a node's primary interface. #544

  nodes. #538
- `wwctl overlay chown` now correctly handles uid and gid arguments. #530
- `wwctl overlay chown` no longer sets gid to `0` when unspecified. #531
- Corrected the path for `.wwbackup` files in some situations. #524
- Bypass `imgextract` for legacy BIOS machines to avoid 32-bit memory
  limitations. #497
- `warewulfd` no longer panics when network interface tags are
  defined. #468
- The wwinit overlay now configures the network device type. #465
- Minor typographical fixes. #528, #519

## 4.3.0, 2022-06-25

### Added

- All configurations files for the host (/etc/exports, /etc/dhcpd.conf, /etc/hosts) are now
  populated from the (OVERLAYDIR/host/etc/{exports|dhcpd|hosts}.ww . Also other configuration
  files like prometheus.yml.ww or slurm.conf.ww which depend on the cluster nodes can be
  placed. Also the new templated functions {{ abort }}, {{ IncludeBlock }} abd {{ no_backup }}
  are allowed now.
- nodes and profiles can now have multiple system and runtime overlays, as a comma separated list.
  The overlays of the profile and the nodes are combined.
- simple ipv6 support is now enabled. In `warewulf.conf` the option `ipaddr6`/`Ipv6net` must
  be set to enable ipv6. If enabled on of these options is set a node will get a derived
  ipv6 in the scheme `ipv6net:ipaddr4`. This address can also be overwritten for every
  node
- Multiple files can now created from a single `template.ww` file with the `{{ file FILENAME }}`
  command in the template. The command is expanded to the magic template command
  `{{ /* file FILENAME */}}` which is picked up by wwctl and everything which comes after this
  magic comment will be written to the file `FILENAME`. This mechanism is leveraged in the
  configuration files for the network, see `ifcfg.xml.ww` and `ifcgf.ww`.
- Networks can now have arbitrary keys value pairs in the profiles and on the node, so that
  things like bridges and mtu sizes can be set
- oci container tar balls can be imported with the 'file://$PATH' scheme
- uids and gids of a container can now get synced at import time, so that at least users with the
  same name have the same uid. This is not necessarily needed for warewulf, but services like
  munge.

### Changed

- Provision interface is not tied to 'eth0' any more. The provision interface must be have the
  'primary' flag now. The file `nodes.conf' must be changed accordingly.
- the provisioning network is now called primary and not default
- Creating of '/etc/exports' can now be disabled, so that `wwctl configure -a` wont overwrite
  a existing '/etc/exports'.
- The yaml format for nodes has now sub-keys for ipmi and kernel, old nodes.conf files have to
  to be changed accordingly
- host overlays can globaly disbaled, but are enabled per default
- `wwctl overlay build -H` will only build the overlays which are assigned to the nodes

## 4.1.0, 2021-07-29

- Installed container directory is deleted when import fails

- In-repository documentation: has been moved to it's own repository

### Fixed

- Importing containers from directory
- Debug log verbosity option takes precedence over verbose option
- `wwctl node list -n` output is formatted corectly

- `wwctl overlay build --all` does not require an argument
- specfile date format works with older versions of rpmbuild
