Warewulf Configuration
======================

The default installation of Warewulf will put all of the configuration
files into ``/etc/warewulf/``. In that directory, you will find the
primary configuration files needed by Warewulf.

warewulf.conf
=============

The Warewulf configuration exists as follows in the current version of
Warewulf (4.5.8):

.. code-block:: yaml

   ipaddr: 10.0.0.1
   netmask: 255.255.252.0
   network: 10.0.0.0
   warewulf:
     port: 9873
     secure: false
     update interval: 60
     autobuild overlays: true
     host overlay: true
     syslog: false
   dhcp:
     enabled: true
     range start: 10.0.1.1
     range end: 10.0.1.255
     systemd name: dhcpd
   tftp:
     enabled: true
     systemd name: tftp
   nfs:
     enabled: true
     export paths:
     - path: /home
       export options: rw,sync
     - path: /opt
       export options: ro,sync,no_root_squash
     systemd name: nfs-server
   image mounts:
     - source: /etc/resolv.conf
       dest: /etc/resolv.conf
       readonly: true
   ssh:
     key types:
       - rsa
       - dsa
       - ecdsa
       - ed25519

Generally you can leave this file as is, as long as you set the
appropriate networking information. Specifically the following
configurations:

* ``ipaddr``: This is the control node's networking interface
  connecting to the cluster's **PRIVATE** network. This configuration
  must match the host's network IP address for the cluster's private
  interface.

* ``netmask``: Similar to the ``ipaddr``, this is the subnet mask for
  the cluster's **PRIVATE** network and it must also match the host's
  subnet mask for the cluster's private interface.

* ``dhcp:range start`` and ``dhcp:range end``: This address range must
  exist in the network defined above. If it is outside of this
  network, failures will occur. This specifies the range of addresses
  you want DHCP to use.

The other configuration options are usually not touched, but they are
explained as follows:

* ``*:enabled``: This can be used to disable Warewulf's control of a
  system service. This is useful if you want to manage that service
  directly.

* ``*:systemd name``: This is so Warewulf can control some of the
  host's services. For the distributions that we've built and tested
  this on, these will require no changes.

* ``warewulf:port``: This is the port that the Warewulf web server
  will be listening on. It is recommended not to change this so there
  is no misalignment with node's expectations of how to contact the
  Warewulf service.

* ``warewulf:secure``: When ``true``, this limits the Warewulf server
  to only respond to runtime overlay requests originating from a
  privileged port. This prevents non-root users from requesting the
  runtime overlay, which may contain sensitive information.

  When ``true``, ``wwclient`` uses TCP port 987.

  Changing this option requires rebuilding node overlays and rebooting
  compute nodes to configure them to use a privileged port.

* ``warewulf:update interval``: This defines the frequency (in
  seconds) with which the Warewulf client on the compute node fetches
  overlay updates.

* ``warewulf:autobuild overlays``: This determines whether per-node
  overlays will automatically be rebuilt, e.g., when an underlying
  overlay is changed.

* ``warewulf:host overlay``: This determines whether the special
  ``host`` overlay is applied to the Warewulf server during
  configuration. (The host overlay is used to configure the dependent
  services.)

* ``warewulf:syslog``: This determines whether Warewulf server logs go
  to syslog.

* ``nfs:export paths``: Warewulf can automatically set up these NFS
  exports.

* ``image mounts``: These paths are mounted into the image
  during ``image exec`` or ``image shell``, typically to allow
  them to operate in the host environment prior to deployment.

Paths
-----

*New in Warewulf v4.5.0*

Default paths to images, overlays, and other Warewulf components
may be overridden using ``warewulf.conf:paths``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   paths:
     sysconfdir: /etc
     localstatedir: /var/lib
     ipxesource: /usr/share/ipxe
     wwoverlaydir: /var/lib/warewulf/overlays
     wwchrootdir: /var/lib/warewulf/chroots
     wwprovisiondir: /var/lib/warewulf/provision
     wwclientdir: /warewulf

* ``sysconfdir``: The parent directory for the ``warewulf`` configuration directory,
  which stores ``warewulf.conf`` and ``nodes.conf``.

* ``ipxesource``: Where to get iPXE binaries.
  These files are copied to ``warewulf.conf:tftp:tftproot`` by ``wwctl configure``.

* ``wwoverlaydir``: The source for Warewulf overlays.

* ``wwchrootdir``: The source for Warewulf images.

* ``wwprovisiondir``: Where to store built overlays and images.

* ``wwclientdir``: Where the Warewulf client looks for its configuration on a provisioned node.

SSH key types
-------------

*New in Warewulf v4.5.1*

SSH key types to generate during ``wwctl configure ssh`` may be overridden using ``warewulf.conf:ssh:key types``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ssh:
     key types:
       - rsa
       - dsa
       - ecdsa
       - ed25519

Warewulf will generate host keys for each listed key type.
The first listed key type is used to generate authentication ssh keys.

nodes.conf
==========

The ``nodes.conf`` file is the primary registry for all compute
nodes. It is a flat text YAML configuration file that is managed by
the ``wwctl`` command, but some sites manage the compute nodes and
infrastructure via configuration management. This file being flat text
and very light weight makes management of the node configurations very
easy no matter what your configuration paradigm is.

For the purpose of this document, we will not go into the detailed
format of this file as it is recommended to edit with the ``wwctl``
command.

.. note::

   This configuration is not written at install time; but, the first
   time you attempt to run ``wwctl``, this file will be generated if
   it does not exist already.

.. note::
   
   When ``nodes.conf`` is edited directly, ``warewulfd`` does not know that the image profile has been changed. Therefore the changes to ``nodes.conf`` are not taken into account by ``warewulfd`` until it is restarted.
   Once you restart ``warewulfd``, the ``nodes.conf`` file is then successfully reloaded.
   This also goes for ``warewulf.conf`` as well - any changes made also require ``warewulfd`` to be restarted.
   The restart should be done using the following command: ``systemctl restart warewulfd``

Upgrades
========

New versions of Warewulf might introduce changes to ``warewulf.conf`` and ``nodes.conf``.
The ``wwctl upgrade`` command can help ease the transition between versions.

.. note::

   ``wwctl upgrade`` will back up any files before it changes them (to ``<name>-old``)
   but it is good practice to back up your configuration manually.

.. code-block:: console

   # wwctl upgrade config
   # wwctl upgrade nodes --add-defaults --replace-overlays

Both upgrade commands support specifying ``--output-path=-``
to print the upgraded configuration file to standard out
for inspection before replacing the configuration files.

Directories
===========

The ``/etc/warewulf/ipxe/`` directory contains *text/templates* that
are used by the Warewulf configuration process to configure the
``ipxe`` service.

FirewallD
=========

When using ``firewalld`` with Warewulf, the following services are required to be added for successful node interconnectivity:

.. code-block:: console

   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=warewulf
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=dhcp
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=tftp

Make sure the ``--reload`` command is ran afterwards:

.. code-block:: console

   firewall-cmd --reload

nftables
========

When deploying ``nftables`` with Warewulf, ensure that TCP port ``9873`` for HTTP requests is available, else you will not be able to add new nodes to the cluster.

This can be done with the ``nft add rule`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport 9873 accept

Save the changes to your ``nftables.conf`` file:

.. code-block:: console

   nft list ruleset > /etc/nftables.conf

Restart the ``nftables`` service:

.. code-block:: console

   systemctl restart nftables
