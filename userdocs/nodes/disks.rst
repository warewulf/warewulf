==================
Provisioning disks
==================

As a tech preview, Warewulf provides structures to define disks, partitions, and
file systems. These structures can generate a configuration for `Ignition`_ to
provision partitions and file systems dynamically on cluster nodes, or with
sfdisk, mkfs, and mkswap during boot.

.. _Ignition: https://coreos.github.io/ignition/

Ignition can, for example, create ``swap`` partitions or ``/scratch`` file
systems.

.. note::

   Warewulf is not currently able to provision the node image onto an explicitly
   provisioned root file system.

Requirements
============

Partition and file system creation requires both ``ignition`` and ``sgdisk`` to
be installed in the image.

Rocky Linux
-----------

.. code-block:: shell

   dnf install ignition gdisk

.. note::

   Packages for Ignition are not currently available for Rocky Linux 8, but it
   is available for Rocky Linux 9 as part of "appstream."

openSuse Leap
-------------

.. code-block:: shell

   zypper install ignition gptfdisk

Disks and partitions
====================

A node or profile can have several disks. Each disk is identified by the path to
its block device. Each disk holds a map to its partitions and a ``bool`` switch
to indicate if an existing, non-matching partition table should be overwritten.

Each partition is identified by its label. The partition number can be omitted,
but specifying it is recommended as Ignition may fail without it. Partition
sizes should also be set (specified in MiB), except for the last partition: if
no size is given, the maximum available size is used. Each partition has the
switches ``should_exist`` and ``wipe_partition_entry`` which control the
partition creation process. When omitting a partition number the
`wipe_partition_entry` should be true, as this allows ignition to replace the
existing partition.

.. code-block:: shell

   wwctl node set n1 \
     --diskname /dev/vda --diskwipe \
     --partname scratch --partcreate --partnumber 1

File systems
============

File systems are identified by their underlying block device, preferably using
the ``/dev/by-partlabel`` format. Except for a ``swap`` partition, an absolute
path for the mount point must be specified for each file system. Depending on
the image used, valid formats are ``btrfs``, ``ext3``, ``ext4``, and ``xfs``.
Each file system has the switch ``wipe_filesystem`` to control whether an
existing file system is wiped.

.. code-block:: shell

   wwctl node set n1 \
     --diskname /dev/vda --partname scratch \
     --fsname scratch --fsformat btrfs --fspath /scratch

Boot-time configuration
=======================

Ignition uses systemd, as the underlying ``sgdisk`` command relies on dbus
notifications.


1. ``ignition-disks-ww4.service`` uses Ignition to create the specified
   partitions and file systems.

2. ``ww4-disks.target`` depends on a matching ``.mount`` unit for each
   mounted file system.
   
3. Each ``.mount`` creates the necessary mount points in the root file system
   and mounts the provisioned file systems during boot.

These services and mount units are generated by the ``ignition`` overlay and
depend on the existence of the file ``/warewulf/ignition.json``, also generated
by the ``ignition`` overlay.

Example disk configurations
===========================

This command formats a btrfs file system on a "scratch" partion of
"vda" and mounts it at ``/scratch``.

.. code-block:: shell

   wwctl node set n1 \
     --diskname /dev/vda --diskwipe \
     --partname scratch --partcreate --partnumber 1 \
     --fsname scratch --fsformat btrfs --fspath /scratch

This command adds a swap partition to the "vda" disk.

.. code-block:: shell

   wwctl node set n1 \
     --diskname /dev/vda \
     --partname swap --partsize=1024 --partnumber 2 \
     --fsname swap --fsformat swap --fspath swap

Re-using or wiping disks
========================

For empty disks the desired configuration is created and the filesystems are
mounted. If partitions or file systems already exist on the disk, ``ignition``
tries to reuse existing file systems by default.

To ignore existing file systems and provision fresh file systems on each boot,
specify the ``--fswipe``` flag for that filesystem, and ``--diskwipe`` for the
disk, as necessary.

If you would like to re-use existing partitions but want to replace existing
file systems once, you may

* wipe the existing data with tools like ``wipefs`` or `dd` [#]_; or
* set the ``--fswipe`` flag and remove it after one reboot.

.. [#] With ``wipefs`` you have to remove the filesystem *and* parition
    information. E.g., use ``wipefs -fa /dev/vda*`` to remove all file system
    information and partition information.

See the `upstream ignition documentation`_ for additional information.
